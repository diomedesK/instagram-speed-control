### Speed and video controls for Instagram

Even thought Instagram interface/code is in constant transformation, this script has been doing me the work for over a year with little to no modifications at all, so I thought it was worth sharing. 

Increase or decrease speed by pressing the ```-``` and the ```=``` keys.

### How to use it?
1. Install both Stylus and TamperMonkey in your browser (they are available both for Mozilla and Chromium)
2. Open 'Create a new script' in TamperMonkey, then paste the code of ```videoControls.js``` into it
3. Open Instagram
4. Click the Stylus extension pop-up followed by 'Write style for ... www,instagram.com'
5. Paste the code of the ```styles.css``` file.

Any other mean of injecting script/styles will also work.
