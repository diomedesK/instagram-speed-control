### Speed and video controls for Instagram

Even though Instagram interface/code is in constant transformation, this script has been doing the work for me for over a year with the need of little to no modifications at all, so I thought it was worth sharing. 

Increase or decrease speed by pressing the ```-``` and the ```=``` keys.

### How to use it?
1. Install Stylus and TamperMonkey extensions in your browser (they are available both for Mozilla and Chromium)
2. Click TamperMonkey pop-up and then  'Create a new script'. Paste the code of ```videoControls.js``` into it and save
3. Open Instagram
4. Click the Stylus extension pop-up followed by 'Write style for ... www,instagram.com'
5. Paste the code of the ```styles.css``` file.

Any other means of injecting scripts or styles will also work.
